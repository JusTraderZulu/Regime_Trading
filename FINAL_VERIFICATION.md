- ❌ 5m higher_tf_disagree

### Post-Gate Plan

**If Gates Clear:**  
- Hypothetical sizing: 20% of max risk (0.20x)
- Blockers to clear: 5m disagrees with 4H, 5m higher_tf_disagree
- Trigger: Wait for alignment across timeframes

**Next Checks:**
- ✓ Confirm: US volatility gate clears
- ⚠️ Re-evaluate: 48h or 12 ST bars
