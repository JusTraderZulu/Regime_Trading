## Quantinsti EPAT Capstone Project

**Author:** Justin Borneo  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Project Status:** Phase 1 Complete + Enhancements  
**Repository:** https://github.com/JusTraderZulu/Regime_Trading.git

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This capstone project presents a **production-ready, multi-agent cryptocurrency regime detection and trading system** that combines rigorous statistical analysis with AI-powered insights to generate actionable trading intelligence.

**Key Innovation:** A dual-tier execution model that analyzes market regimes on medium-term (4H) data for clean signals, then backtests strategies on short-term (15m) data for realistic execution simulation.

---

## 📊 What Was Accomplished

### **Phase 1: Core Multi-Timeframe System (Complete)**

#### **1. Multi-Tier Regime Detection**

Implemented three-tier analysis framework:
- **Long-Term (LT):** 1D bars, 730-day lookback - Macro trend context
- **Medium-Term (MT):** 4H bars, 120-day lookback - **Primary regime detection**
- **Short-Term (ST):** 15m bars, 30-day lookback - Execution simulation

**Rationale:** Different timeframes reveal different market dynamics. MT (4H) provides cleaner signals than noisy ST (15m) for regime classification, while ST shows realistic execution fills.

#### **2. Advanced Statistical Analysis (5 Methods)**

Implemented robust regime detection using weighted voting from:
1. **Hurst Exponent (R/S method)** - Measures trend persistence
2. **Hurst Exponent (DFA method)** - Alternative calculation for validation
3. **Variance Ratio Tests** - Statistical test for mean reversion vs trending
4. **ADF Stationarity Tests** - Confirms regime characteristics
5. **Autocorrelation Analysis** - Detects serial correlation patterns

**Enhancements:**
- Bootstrap confidence intervals on Hurst (statistical significance testing)
- Outlier-robust Hurst calculation (crypto flash crash resistant)
- Weighted voting system (35% Hurst, 25% VR, 20% ACF, 15% ADF, 5% Vol)

#### **3. Multi-Strategy Testing & Selection**

Implemented 9 trading strategies across regime types:

**Trend-Following (4 strategies):**
- Moving Average Crossover
- Exponential MA Crossover  
- MACD
- Donchian Breakout

**Mean-Reversion (3 strategies):**
- Bollinger Bands
- RSI
- Keltner Channels

**Special/Baseline (2 strategies):**
- ATR-Filtered Trend (volatile markets)
- Carry/Hold (baseline)

**System automatically:**
- Tests ALL applicable strategies for detected regime
- Selects best performer by Sharpe ratio
- Displays comparison table in report

#### **4. Comprehensive Backtesting Engine**

**40+ Institutional-Grade Metrics:**

**Risk-Adjusted Performance:**
- Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Omega ratios
- Information Ratio

**Risk Metrics:**
- Value at Risk (VaR 95%, 99%)
- Conditional VaR / Expected Shortfall
- Ulcer Index (pain metric)
- Maximum Drawdown with confidence intervals

**Trade Analytics:**
- Win rate, Profit Factor, Expectancy
- Average win/loss, best/worst trades
- Consecutive win/loss streaks
- Trade duration and exposure time

**Drawdown Analysis:**
- Number of drawdown periods
- Average drawdown depth and duration
- Current drawdown from peak

**Baseline Comparison:**
- Buy-and-hold performance
- Alpha (excess return)
- Tracking error

**Transaction Cost Modeling:**
- Spread: 5 bps
- Slippage: 3 bps  
- Fees: 2 bps
- Total: 10 bps per trade (realistic for crypto)

#### **5. Multi-Agent Validation Architecture**

**Contradictor Agent (Red-Team):**
- Re-runs analysis with alternate timeframes
- Identifies fragile signals
- Adjusts confidence downward if contradictions found

**Judge Agent (Quality Gate):**
- Pydantic schema validation
- NaN and outlier detection
- Bounds checking
- Data quality assurance

#### **6. AI-Powered Recommendations (OpenAI Integration)**

LLM generates:
- Natural language market narrative
- **Parameter optimization suggestions** based on regime characteristics
- Specific Take Profit / Stop Loss levels (ATR-based)
- Position sizing recommendations (confidence-weighted)
- Regime change warning signals

**Example Output:**
```
"Given strong trend (H=0.64) with moderate volatility:
- Adjust MA from 10/30 → 8/25 for faster entries
- Set TP at 2.5x ATR ($68 above entry)
- Set SL at 1.5x ATR ($41 below entry)
- Position size: 2% of capital (60% confidence)"
```

#### **7. Cross-Asset Context (CCM Agent)**

Analyzes nonlinear coupling with:
- **Crypto sector:** ETH-USD, SOL-USD
- **Macro indicators:** SPY, DXY, VIX

**Outputs:**
- Sector coupling score (crypto-specific moves)
- Macro coupling score (risk-on/off regime)
- Decoupled flag (idiosyncratic behavior)

#### **8. Professional Reporting**

**Three Output Formats:**
1. **Markdown** - LLM-ready structured data
2. **PDF** - Professional presentation quality (optional)
3. **JSON** - All data for programmatic access

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Pipeline (10 Nodes):**

```
1. setup_artifacts   → Create output directory
2. load_data         → Fetch OHLCV (LT/MT/ST)
3. compute_features  → Calculate 5 statistical methods
4. ccm_agent         → Cross-asset coupling analysis
5. detect_regime     → Weighted voting classification
6. select_strategy   → Map regime to strategies
7. backtest         → Test on MT, execute on ST
8. contradictor     → Red-team validation
9. judge            → Quality gates
10. summarizer      → AI-enhanced report generation
```

### **Decision Flow:**

```
LT (1D) → Provides macro trend context
   ↓
MT (4H) → PRIMARY regime detection + strategy selection
   ↓       (Tests 4+ strategies, selects best)
   ↓
ST (15m) → Executes selected strategy for realistic fills
   ↓
AI (GPT-4) → Parameter optimization + TP/SL recommendations
```

### **Key Design Principles:**

1. **Schema-Driven:** Pydantic validation ensures type safety
2. **Modular:** Each component independently testable
3. **Extensible:** Easy to add new strategies/features
4. **Production-Ready:** Error handling, logging, monitoring
5. **Explainable:** Every decision has rationale and audit trail

## 🏆 Notable Features & Innovations

### **1. Weighted Voting System**

Unlike single-indicator systems, this uses consensus from 5 independent statistical methods:
- Reduces false positives
- More robust than any single method
- Shows transparency (voting breakdown in reports)

### **2. Multi-Strategy Testing**

Instead of assuming one strategy per regime, the system:
- Tests all applicable strategies
- Compares performance objectively
- Auto-selects best performer
- Shows comparison table for transparency

### **3. Dual-Tier Execution Model**

Professional approach mirroring institutional trading:
- **Analyze on MT (4H):** Clean signals, less noise
- **Execute on ST (15m):** Realistic fills, transaction costs
- Reflects real-world trading where you analyze on higher TF, execute on lower TF

### **4. AI Parameter Optimization**

LLM analyzes regime characteristics and suggests:
- Specific parameter adjustments (e.g., "MA 10/30 → 8/25")
- Rationale based on Hurst, volatility, confidence
- Expected performance improvement
- Regime-specific TP/SL levels

### **5. Baseline Comparison**

Every backtest compared against buy-and-hold:
- Alpha (excess return)
- Information Ratio  
- Proves strategy adds value (or doesn't)
- Essential for any trading system validation

## 📈 Results & Insights

### **Key Finding: Short-Term Crypto is Noisy**

Analysis of BTC, ETH, XRP on 15m bars often showed "random" or low-confidence regimes. This is **appropriate and correct** because:

1. **Microstructure noise** dominates at 15m without L2 orderbook
2. **HFT activity** creates randomness
3. **News shocks** disrupt short-term patterns

**Solution:** Use MT (4H) for regime detection, ST (15m) for execution simulation. Phase 2 will add L2 data for true microstructure analysis.

### **Validation:**

The Contradictor agent successfully identifies:
- Borderline p-values
- Regime fragility across timeframes
- Low-confidence classifications

This prevents overconfident recommendations on uncertain regimes.
