## ⚠️ Expected Warnings (Not Errors)

These warnings are **normal and handled gracefully**:

1. **"pyEDM CCM failed... sample must be non-zero"**
   - Some asset pairs don't have enough data
   - Falls back to correlation proxy
   - Still produces CCM results

2. **"No data returned for X:SYMBOL 1m"**
   - Some crypto pairs don't have 1m execution buffer
   - Uses what's available
   - Doesn't block analysis

3. **"Judge found N warnings"**
   - Low confidence warnings (informational)
   - CCM missing for some tiers (expected)
   - Judge still validates successfully

4. **"401 Authorization Required" for some assets**
   - Some symbols not available in your subscription
   - System retries then continues
   - Uses available data

---

## 🔧 Performance

- **Single Analysis**: ~75 seconds (with all features)
- **Scanner**: ~60 seconds (10-27 symbols)
- **Portfolio (3 assets)**: ~4 minutes
- **Complete Workflow**: ~20 minutes (scan → analyze top 15)
